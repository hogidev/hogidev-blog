Hi guys. In this guide, I will share my current environment setting for web development. Whether you are a new developer, or you simply just bought yourself a new macbook, I hope you will find the information useful to you.

## 1. XCode

Xcode is a development tools developed by Apple to develop, test apps for all Apple platforms. Installing **Xcode** is pretty straightforward

You can download and install it from [**App  Store**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/). However this way it will download the whole IDE (20GB+) and for a Web Developer it may not be necessary. You can just use its CLI (For use Git, Homebrew, or compiling code).

To install the CLI, run it in Terminal:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Then click **Install** in the prompt that pops up.

ðŸ“¦ This installs only the **Xcode Command Line Tools**, which are ~1GB â€” much smaller than full Xcode.

## 2. Homebrew
Homebrew is the package to manage for macOS and using to install a lot of tools like git, node, xcode,...

Copy and paste this command into your terminal:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Following the guide to input your sudo password or press *RETURN/ENTER* to complete the installation. When the installation is complete, reopen your terminal to use Homebrew. You can check everything is working by running:
```bash
brew-doctor
```
If you see the warning instead *"ready to brew!"*, don't worry . You can run below promt to verify Homebrew working fine:
```bash
brew-search-iterm2
```

## 3. iTerm2 / Wrap
If your current terminal is really boring, you might consider using iTerm2 by running the following command:
```bash
brew install --cask iterm2
```
### Customization
This customize can improve your terminal experience. But this is optional, you can skip if you feel it not interested
- Download theme from [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://iterm2colorschemes.com/) and import your favorite profile
- Install Zsh + Oh My Zsh for better prompts and plugins (Since MacOS Catalina, zsh has been set as the default)
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
Then pick a theme from .zshrc, e.g., ZSH_THEME="agnoster" or use Powerlevel10k:
```bash
brew install romkatv/powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k
```
Then in .zshrc:
```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```
Besides iTerm2, recently I switched to another Rust-based terminal which is easier to use, install and more support with AI, is Warp.
To install Warp, run the following command:
```bash
brew install --cask warp
```

## 4. Git
If you are a developer, you must use Git. To install, run:
```bash
brew install git
```
When done, verify that by using **git --version** and set git config
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```
### Set up SSH
You need to follow the [**Official documentation of Github**](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) for setup SSH config.
I won't describe the steps in detail in this blog

## 5. NVM & Node
NVM is a cross-platform Node.js version manager. To install, run:
```bash
brew install nvm
```
Create NVM directory
```bash
mkdir ~./nvm
```
Config shell. Add the following config to .zshrc or .bashrc. If these 2 files do not exist, create them by:
```bash
touch ~/.zshrc
```
Then, open this file to add config:
```bash
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm" ] && \. "/opt/homebrew/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion.d/nvm"
```
Then, apply the changes:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
Install Node with NVM
```bash
nvm install node # or nvm install node --version
nvm use node # or nvm use --version
# Verify the Node.js version
node -v
```
You can switch between Node.js versions in specific projects or directories.

## 6. IDEs
1. Visual studio code

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor with support for many programming languages through extensions

To install the latest version, use Homebrew:
```bash
brew install --cask visual-studio-code
```

2. WebStorm

WebStorm is the JavaScript and TypeScript IDE. JetBrains now accepts Free for non-commercial use. You can download it via here [**WebStorm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)
